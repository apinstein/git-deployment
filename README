A deployment workflow in git.

This scenario uses a GitHub repo as the canonical "master" for the project.

On Dev Boxes:
Pulls/Pushes from/to "github".
local branch "to-deploy" tracks "github/to-deploy".

On Staging Server:
Pulls from "github".
local branch "staging" tracks "github/to-deploy".

On Production Server:
Pulls from "staging"; named "make-it-live".
local branch "production" tracks "staging/staging".

Developers work on features in local branches, merge with master, and push to github.

When you want to deploy, you checkout the "github/to-deploy" branch, merge in desired features, and push.

When you want to promote staging to the current "github/to-deploy" branch, run "git pull" on staging.

When you want to promote the code from staging to production, run "git pull make-it-live" on production.

HOWTO:
1. On dev box:

git clone --origin github git://github.com/apinstein/git-deployment.git
cd git-deployment

2. Create the "to-deploy" remote branch on github.

git push github master:refs/heads/to-deploy

3. Create awesome new feature

cat "Awesome new feature" > VERSION
git commit -a -m "awesomeness"

3. Prepare code for deployment

git checkout --track -b to-deploy github/to-deploy
git merge master
git push github

4. Set up staging server to receive to-deploy branch from GitHub.

git clone --origin github git://github.com/apinstein/git-deployment.git
cd git-deployment

git checkout --track -b staging github/to-deploy
git branch -d master

5. Set up production server to receive staging branch from staging server.

git clone --origin staging /path/to/stagingrepo/git-deployment
cd git-deployment

git checkout --track -b production staging/staging
git branch -d staging

6. To deploy latest to-deploy to staging, run this command on staging

git pull

7. To deploy latest staging to production, run this command on production

git pull
